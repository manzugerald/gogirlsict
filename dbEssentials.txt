Steps to run a new table on a database:
Assuming we have a database with two existing tables that already have data in them;
To add a new table called "messages", first, generate the prisma object. Then, migrate the changes to the PostgreSQL database.
After the migration is complete, proceed with database seeding. This should show the inserted items either in prisma studio or pgAdmin4
1. npx prisma generate
2. npx prisma migrate dev --name add_homepage_and_projects_and_messages_tables
3. npx tsx prisma/message.ts
